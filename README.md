•	Done on 180nm node
•	I used square law for sizing, as short channel effects are not much severe for L>2*Lmin
•	Output stage L was kept small so as to decrease output resistance, thereby increasing PM
•	go through word file attached to get overview of design and simulations
•	I have attached zip file of this project,simply upload in your system and run it
